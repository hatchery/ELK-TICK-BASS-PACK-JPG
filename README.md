Logging Pipeline and Chief.
This is a joke, but totally serious.

- G - Grafana:
    * A dashboard visualization tool
- G - Grafana again
    * The initialism was better with 2, but it's also that good
- W - Watcher
    * Elasticsearch watcher to notify you of anomalies
- P - Prometheus
    * A time series metrics client/server system
- E - Elasticsearch
    * A full-text search-oriented data store
- L - Logstash
    * A structured log collection daemon
- K - Kafka
    * A distributed pub/sub message queue for passing data through federated logstash systems into a logstash collector
- K - Kibana
    * A data visualization and discovery system for elasticsearch
- T - Telegraf
    * A data collection instrument for Influx and Prometheus
- I - InfluxDB
    * A time series database
- C - Chronograf
    * A query creation and data discovery system for influxdb and prometheus
- K - Kapacitor
    * An anomaly detection system for InfluxDB


Clearly a system for collecting all data in all ways and keeping it forever and ever.
